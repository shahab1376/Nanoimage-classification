# Nanoimage Classification
Deep learning is a great approach that can help us to do fantastic AI based processes and develop our models. The base element of models implemented by deep learning is a neuron, as well as neural networks are usual and effective method for building and developing state-of-the-art models. Most solved problem in machine learining is classification problem, however since in deep learning we work with visual data, neurons will be brought up to acheive the solution.

This project is being done to classify CNT and SEM nanoimages taken from the university chemistrical labs. For improving the progress, we've divided this work into 3 aproaches.

First approach is supervised classification. Labels are known (two labels exist) and classification is done by finite number of train images (100 images). This work is basicaly prominent for initiating our effort, however the forwarding approachs are required for putting it forward.

Second approach comes out of our necessity of large amount of train images. There is a generative work before the classification. Our work is still supervised but with large amount of generated train samples, we have more accuracy. Moreover we will work with a different predefined configuration of layers using a popular network.

Last approach is to use a totaly different network called capsule. We expect different results from it and we take account into this variety.
